# Horiseon Markup
A website template designed for Horiseon marketing agency to help them reach customers with an web application that is optimized to reach the target 
audience in different search engines.

## Usage
View the HTML and CSS file to see that they are semantically organized and that classes and ids are grouped together accordingly. When you view the title attribute,
it is now a descriptive title for the webpage. I've added alt attributes to all of the images. The header elements are also all in decreasing order.
